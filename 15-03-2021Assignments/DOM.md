# JAVASCRIPT DOM
**DOM stands for Document Object Module.**     
The **Document Object Module** is an interface that defines the logical structure of and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. 

With the *document object module*, programmers can *build documents, navigate their structure, and add, modify, or delete elements and contents.* Anything found in an HTML or XML docment can be accessed, changed, deleted or added using the document object module, with a few exceptions.

With javascript DOM, we can perform multiple tasks, create new elements and attributes, change the existing elements and attributes and even remove existing elements and attributes. Javascript an also react to existing events and create new event in the page.

##  Few Examples of Methods used to manipulate DOM using Javascript:
+ ***getElementById();*** - used to access elements and attributes whose id is set.
+ ***innerHTML***: used to access the content of an element.
+ ***document.querySelector();*** - this can be used to pick any element on our HTML page. this can be either a class, an id or any tag.
+ ***document.createElement();*** - this creates a new element.
+ ***textContent*** - this is used to specify or set the HTML contents inside the element.
