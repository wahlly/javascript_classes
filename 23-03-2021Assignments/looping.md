# DIFFENRENCE BETWEEN THE TWO CODE BLOCKS(for...of and forEach loop):   
Both functions are going to give same results. So, the difference with Using any of them is that using the forEach loop, we can access the array index directly,  while with for...of you don't. unless you specify in the code function block.
